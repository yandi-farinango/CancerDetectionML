# **Early Cancer Detection with Machine Learning**

Breast Cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women.¹

The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about 1 in 39.¹

Because breast cancer may not always show clear signs/symptoms in its early stages, malignant tumors can go undiscovered for a long period of time.

One of the biggest challenges faced in the fight against breast cancer is late-stage diagnosis.

Unquestionably, the most important prognostic element for breast cancer is an early diagnosis.²

Fortunately, thanks to advances in Healthcare Technology and AI physicians are now able to detect cancerous tumors earlier than ever before.

In [this article](https://medium.com/@farinango.yandi/early-cancer-detection-with-machine-learning-2f908015a84d)  we’ll explore how Machine Learning can be used to detect cancerous tumors.
